# Testing Assignment

## User Story 1
**Analysis**
- User Story:
  - As a user I want to be able to view a list of all users of the site so that I can see who uses the site.
- Happy Path:
  - **Given** User is logged in
  - **When** Accessing the users page
  - **Then** The user and all other users are visible.
- Sad Path:
  - **Given** User is a guest(account-less)
  - **When** User goes to the users page
  - **Then** The user is unable to access the page.
    - **And** The user is redirected to log in.

**Design**
- The users page displays a list of all users.
- The users page can only be accessed by authenticated users.
- The users page displays stats regarding the users, like total count.

**Testing**
- **System Tests**
  - *Happy Path*
    - Checks if the users page is accessible by a user, if the userâ€™s name is displayed on the page, as well if the total user count is displayed.
  - *Sad Path*
    - It tests to see if the middleware is functioning properly, like in the event a user is not logged in and as such should not see the users page and instead be redirected to the login page.
- **Unit Tests**
  - Verifies if the total user count is correctly calculated.
- **Comments**
  - Why some parts are not tested
    - We don't test if the user is an admin because they can see the page by default for being authenticated. We also don't check if the users list is displayed correctly beyond the accuracy of information, like with multiple users instead of one.

**Completed Tests**

**Evaluation**
- The test is able to check if the users page is accessible by authenticated users as well as if it displays accurate information.
- The test does not check if more than one user can be displayed.
- We can conclude that the tests ensure the only accessible to users user list is functioning and viewable. The tests only cover the default uses of the user story.
- Improvement: 
  - The system test checks to see if the user is redirected and to the login page, but in the event that that logic changes the test would not be able to cover it. It would be improvement to cover this issue.


## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
